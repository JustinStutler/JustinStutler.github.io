      <h3>MagMutual Insurance - Intern/ Contractor</h3>
      <p>May 2020 - December 2020</p>
      <p>This was my first experience coding as a developer in an agile workflow. I began the internship with no knowledge of Javascript, Html, CSS, or SQL. I learned enough over the summer to be hired on as a full stack javascript contractor to build dynamic web applications.</p>

    <div class="job">
      <h3>PieHole - Baker/ Manager</h3>
      <p>2016-2018</p>
      <p>Beginning as a baker, I learned many skills such as communication, problem-solving, time management, how to work well under pressure, and teamwork. Eventually, I became a manager and learned how to teach and lead others. Thanksgiving was particularly challenging with the large amount of orders, but this gave me the opportunity to lead a small team of 4 through the holidays.</p>
